# World Association

The World Association is an innovative political organization that's revolutionizing global cooperation. We integrate democratic values with cutting-edge digital technologies to transcend traditional models of international governance.

## Mission

The mission of the Association is to democratically solve humanity's pressing global challenges.

## Projects

We are currently working on initiatives such as

- the establishment of a framework for global democracy,
- an anonymous yet verifiably democratic online voting system, and
- a global basic income program, streamed in our digital currency, the world drachma.
