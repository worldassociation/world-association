# World Association

The World Association is an innovative political organization that's revolutionizing global cooperation. We integrate democratic values with state-of-the-art digital technologies to transcend traditional models of international governance.

Our mission is to address the critical and pressing global challenges of human survival, development, and welfare with effective and modern solutions.

We are working on initiatives such as the establishment of a global democracy framework and an anonymous yet provably democratic online voting system using zero-knowledge proofs. We are also introducing a global basic income program, distributed in our digital currency, the world drachma.
