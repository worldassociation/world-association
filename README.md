The World Association is an innovative political organization that's revolutionizing global cooperation. We integrate democratic values with cutting-edge digital technologies to transcend traditional models of international governance.

## Mission

Our mission is to address the critical and pressing global challenges of human survival, development, and welfare with effective and modern solutions.

## Projects

We are working on initiatives such as

- the establishment of a framework for global democracy,
- building an anonymous yet verifiably democratic online voting system, and
- introducing a global basic income program, streamed in our digital currency, the world drachma.
