# World Association

The World Association is a democratic organization that is open to everyone. Join us anonymously to experiment with global democracy and to help us solve humanity's most pressing global challenges.

## Projects

We are currently working on initiatives like

- the establishment of a framework for global democracy,
- an anonymous yet verifiably democratic online voting system, and
- a global basic income program, streamed in our digital currency, the world drachma.

This repository has two main folders:

```bash
.
├── apps
│   │   contribute
│   └── web
└── organization
    │   constitution
    └── roadmap
```

The [apps](/apps) folder contains all our frontend code.

The [organization](/organization) folder contains all our governing documents.
