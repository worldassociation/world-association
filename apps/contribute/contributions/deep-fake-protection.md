# Deep Fake Protection System

## Summary

The [AttestationStation](https://docs.optimism.io/chain/identity/overview) is a simple and unified way to make attestations on OP Mainnet, OP Goerli, or any other OP Stack-based chain.

Creators could use attestations to signal that a livestream, video, image, or clip is from their real account(s). Each attestation could be tied to a specific URL or other resource identifier. A plugin could then highlight the content that have been explicitly attested to by creators.

## Possible Features

- Allow creators to manage attestations over the validity of specific pieces of content.
- Allow users to easily check if a given piece of content has been attested to by the creator.
- Allow users to see attestations on other websites with a plugin.

## Why this is cool

- Combats deep-fakes with verifiable content
- Creates an on-chain link between content and original creators
- Foundation for a content discovery service that benefits Web3 creators
