# OP Mainnet Resource Usage Tracker

## Summary

As OP Mainnet and other L2 solutions gain traction, it becomes increasingly important to monitor and understand the resource consumption on these chains. Currently, it's challenging to get a clear picture of resource usage across gas, storage, and calldata. This project aims to create a comprehensive L2 resource usage monitoring tool that visualizes these aspects in real time and offers insights into usage patterns on OP Mainnet.

## Possible Features

- Real-time visualization: Display the use of resources such as gas, calldata, and storage in real-time.
- In-depth resource analysis: Show detailed statistics of resource usage per transaction and the storage occupied by each contract.
- Filters: Allow users to filter the displayed data based on various parameters, including time, type of transaction, contract, and more.
- Bonus feature: Being able to point the UI to other OP Stack chains.

## Why this is cool

- Valuable insights for developers: This tool will provide in-depth resource usage insights, helping developers optimize their dapps for L2.
- Contribute to network health and optimization: Understanding resource usage patterns can help in taking steps to further optimize the OP Mainnet network.
- Promote efficient resource usage: By highlighting resource usage, this tool will encourage better coding practices and more efficient usage of network resources, contributing to a more scalable and sustainable network.
