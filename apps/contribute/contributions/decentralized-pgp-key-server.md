# Decentralized PGP Key Server

## Summary

Use attestations to create a decentralized [key server](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_server_(cryptographic)>) for [PGP keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy). For instance, make it easy for users to attest that a public key is valid, and display a trust score for that keyâ€™s validity. This creates a [web of trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust) model between users and their public keys.

## Possible Features

- Allow users to easily attest to the validity of a PGP key
- Create a trust score based on attestations between keys
- Check the trust score for a given key
