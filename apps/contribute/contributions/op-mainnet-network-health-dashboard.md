# Public OP Mainnet Network Health Dashboard

Description of the request/idea/contribution. 

## Summary

Users need clear, constant insight into the functional behaviors of OP Mainnet. In order to provide insights and better understanding of the state and performance of the L2 network, the L2 Network Health Dashboard will offer a range of crucial statistics in a visual, easy-to-understand format. As an important part of the ecosystem, the ability to monitor the health and performance of the L2 network will allow developers, users, and operators to make informed decisions and adjustments.

## Possible Features 

- Like all ideas from this list, the code should be fully open source, ideally MIT licenced. 
- The dashboard should:
    - be built using Grafana for real-time monitoring and interaction.
    - have instructions on how to populate the dashboard.
    - track transaction latency and offer insights into the average, peak, and minimum transaction times.
    - keep track of the costs associated with specific actions on the network.
    - track the speed of block production and highlight any significant deviations.
    - be able to track reorganizations on the network.
    - be able to track the time taken for a block to be produced and sent to L1.
    - track block finalization times.
- Flexibility for adding additional metrics or data points as they become relevant or necessary.

## Why this is cool 

- The dashboard will provide critical insights into the performance of the L2 network, allowing for informed decision making.
- The data collected and displayed could help identify any bottlenecks or areas of inefficiency on the network.
- By making this information easily accessible, the dashboard could encourage the growth and development of the network by providing developers with the information they need to optimize their applications and services.
- Having this kind of transparency could increase trust and confidence in the network. Users and developers alike will have a clearer understanding of how the network operates and performs under various conditions.
