# Events Ticketing Application

## Summary

The [AttestationStation](https://docs.optimism.io/chain/identity/overview) is a simple and unified way to make attestations on OP Mainnet, OP Goerli, or any other OP Stack-based chain.

You can use the AttestationStation to create a ticketing application for events by allowing anyone to register an event, issue tickets, or revoke tickets. Everything should be represented as an attestation.

## Possible Features

- Allow organizers to register an event, and store event details onchain via attestations.
- Allow organizers to issue tickets via attestations.
- Allow organizers to revoke tickets via attestations.
- Allow organizers to verify tickets by scanning a QR code.
- Bonus points if the app can handle bad internet (as is often the case at large events).

## Why this is cool

- Ticketing data is very useful for other applications using the AttestationStation
- Crypto ticketing apps are lackluster right now and there is a strong need for better options
- More people would use the AttestationStation in general
