# Embedded Gateway Widget

## Summary

The [Optimism Gateway app](https://app.optimism.io) is an easy way to transfer funds to and from OP Mainnet. Can you create an embedded version of the Gateway that other applications can easily include in their own websites? Ideally, this looks like a widget with a great design that mirrors the Optimism Gateway design.

## Possible Features

- Allow app developers to add the Embedded Gateway Widget to their own websites.
- Allow users to bridge funds to/from OP Mainnet via the Embedded Gateway Widget.
