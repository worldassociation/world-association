# Liquidity Types Explainer

Liquidity is an important factor for many applications. However, Liquidity comes in many different shapes and sizes. It would be highly valuable to have a detailed reference document that explains all the different ways that liquidity might be useful for a project.

Examples of possible usecases for liquidity include:

- Liquidity for bridges that speeds up the process of moving assets between chains
- Liquidity for lending markets that makes an asset more widely available
- Liquidity for decentralized exchanges that reduces slippage when exchanging assets

## Possible Features

- Create a detailed list of the different ways liquidity might impact an application
- Give examples of different applications that make use of liquidity in the listed ways
- Describe potential ways that liquidity might be useful in the future

## Why this is cool

- Liquidity can be confusing for those who aren't already familiar with it, this document would help reduce that gap
- Help illuminate what type of liquidity might influence the creation of what type of app
