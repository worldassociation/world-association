# Onchain Activity Feed

## Summary
Create an app that allows you to easily visualize the activities of addresses that you interact with. Ideally this consists of a website or mobile app that visualizes friend activity onchain in an engaging and interactive way. Maybe you could use the [AttestationStation](https://docs.optimism.io/chain/identity/about-attestations#benefits-of-using-ethereum-attestation-service) to allow users to send each other friend requests.

## Possible Features
* Allow users to see the addresses that they've interacted with.
* Allow users to see what those addresses are up to now.
* Share activity with certain users and hide it from others.
* Send friend requests via the [AttestationStation](https://docs.optimism.io/chain/identity/about-attestations#benefits-of-using-ethereum-attestation-service).
