# Adding a Request

Currently the ideas list is not open to the public for ideas. The following groups and organisations are able to add:

* Developer Advisory Board
* Core development teams
    * OP Labs
    * Coinbase 
    * etc

Adding is limited to these groups as this iteration of the ideas list is focused on having a super high quality list of builder focused ideas. 

If you would like to submit an idea anyway, feel free to open a PR. Please ensure you follow the [template](../contributions/adding-a-request/TEMPLATE.md). Take note of the character limits.
