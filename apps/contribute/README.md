## World Association Grants 101

Currently, the Association runs grant rounds a couple times a year where projects that create the most impact are eligible for rewards.

We have exciting grants coming up!

- Onchain Builders grants reward onchain builders for driving the adoption of Optimism
- OP Stack grants will contributions to the OP stack
- Governance grants will contributions which improve the capture resistance and resource allocation of Optimism Governance
