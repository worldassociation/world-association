# World Association Documentation

## Overview

The World Association is a pioneering organization dedicated to democratizing global governance. Our mission is to empower individuals worldwide by enabling anonymous participation in decision-making processes, addressing humanity’s most urgent challenges collectively. Our platform is accessible and free to use, providing members with a basic income and a voice in global decisions through a transparent and secure voting system.

### Why is this important?

As advanced AI and other technologies evolve, there is a risk of increasing global inequality, undemocratic practices, and even authoritarian control. Without proactive and inclusive governance, AI could catalyze global totalitarianism, exacerbate winner-take-all markets, and displace labor, leading to a permanent lock-in of harmful values and amplified risks of extinction due to reduced governmental competence. The World Association aims to counter these risks by promoting global cooperation, democratic decision-making, and equitable resource distribution.

## Core features

### Global basic income

- **Receive income**: Once verified, you will receive a regular basic income in our official currency, the world drachma. This initiative aims to promote economic stability and equality, ensuring that everyone has access to basic financial resources.
- **Superfluid streams**: Our basic income is distributed by-the-second using [Superfluid](https://www.superfluid.finance), a cutting-edge protocol that enables real-time financial transactions. This ensures seamless, instant financial support, allowing members to access their income continuously without delays or the need for manual transactions.

By providing a basic income, we aim to reduce economic disparities, foster global financial inclusion, and empower individuals to participate actively in the global economy.

### Proposals and democratic voting

Voting tokens are minted and distributed to members automatically upon joining. We guarantee the one-person-one-vote principle through our robust verification process, ensuring that each member has an equal voice.

- **Create proposals**: Submit proposals using [our space on Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/worldassociation.eth), a free platform for decentralized voting.
- **Vote with Snapshot**: Participate in the decision-making process by voting on proposals.

All proposals and votes are recorded, ensuring transparency and trust.

## Technology
