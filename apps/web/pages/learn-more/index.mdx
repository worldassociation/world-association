## Overview

The World Association is a revolutionary platform aiming to democratize global governance. By allowing anyone to join anonymously and participate in decision-making processes, we empower individuals to contribute to solving humanity's most pressing challenges. Our platform is free to use, offering members a basic income and a voice in global decisions through a transparent and secure voting system.

### Why is this important?

As advanced AI and other technologies evolve, there is a risk of increasing global inequality, undemocratic practices, and even authoritarian control. Without proactive and inclusive governance, AI could catalyze global totalitarianism, exacerbate winner-take-all markets, and displace labor, leading to a permanent lock-in of harmful values and amplified risks of extinction due to reduced governmental competence. The World Association aims to counter these risks by promoting global cooperation, democratic decision-making, and equitable resource distribution.

## Getting started

### Joining the platform

1. **Sign in**: Easily sign in using social login, email, mobile number, or a passkey. A wallet is automatically created for you during this process.
2. **Verify uniqueness**: Complete an identity verification using zkMe's MeID, which ensures your anonymity while confirming that you are a real and unique human.

To balance the need for anonymity with democratic decision-making, we use a novel approach: proof of personhood checks. People undergo a verification process that ensures they can only join once, while maintaining their privacy using homomorphic encryption. [Learn more](https://zk.me/did-solution).

## Core features

### Global basic income

- **Receive income**: Once verified, you will receive a regular basic income in our official currency, the world drachma.
- **Superfluid streams**: Our basic income is distributed by-the-second using Superfluid, providing real-time, seamless financial support. [Learn more](https://www.superfluid.finance).

### Proposals and voting

Voting tokens are minted and distributed to members automatically upon joining.

- **Create proposals**: Submit proposals using [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/worldassociation.eth), a free platform for decentralized voting. [Learn more](https://docs.snapshot.org/introduction).
- **Vote with Snapshot**: Participate in the decision-making process by voting on proposals.

All proposals and votes are recorded, ensuring transparency and trust.

## Technology and security

- **Decentralized infrastructure**: We leverage the Base Layer 2 blockchain for our tokens, ensuring low transaction costs and high scalability.
- **Smart contracts**: Our platform operates on secure smart contracts deployed on the Base network, managing everything from user verification to proposal voting.
- **Homomorphic encryption**: Anonymity and security are guaranteed through zkMe's proof of personhood checks using homomorphic encryption. This method verifies identities without compromising privacy. [Learn more](https://zk.me/did-solution).
